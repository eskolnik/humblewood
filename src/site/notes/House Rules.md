# Rules Addenda

## Proficiencies

If you would become proficient in a skill or tool and you already had that proficiency, gain a different proficiency of your choice of the same type.

## Natural 20 Or 1

In some editions of D&D, rolling a natural 20 or a natural 1 meant automatic success or failure respectively on any roll. This has been revised in the 5e rules to only apply to natural 20's rolled in combat (turning them in to critical hits), a change I mostly agree with - not everything you might choose to attempt will have at least a 5% chance of success. However, those times when you do roll particularly well (or poorly) still should feel impactful, and so you can expect that there may be some extra effect or bonus on rolling 20's and 1's. Specific examples TBD.

## Lucky Acorn

Replaces the [Heroic Inspiration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#HeroicInspiration) rules. These are entirely separate from the Luck Points granted by the [Lucky](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:lucky) feat.

### Acquisition

- If you miss an attack roll you gain 1 Acorn.
- If you fail a saving throw you gain 1 Acorn.
- The DM may award an Acorn for the typical Heroic Inspiration reasons.
- You can never have more than 5 Acorns. If you would gain a sixth, you immediately roll a d4 and now have that many Acorns instead.

### Uses

- After you roll to make a check (but before learning the outcome) you can spend 1 or more  Acorns to add +1 to the roll for each Acorn spent.
	- This can't create a natural 20 or prevent a natural 1.
- Spend 2 or more Acorns to aid an ally you can see on a check (as above). Add +1 for each 2 Acorn spent to enhance the roll. 
- After you make ANY roll you can also spend 3 Acorns to re-roll all the dice and keep the higher result.
