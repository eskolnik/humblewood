# Rules Addenda

## Proficiencies

If you would become proficient in a skill or tool and you already had that proficiency, gain a different proficiency of your choice of the same type.

## Natural 20 Or 1

In some editions of D&D, rolling a natural 20 or a natural 1 meant automatic success or failure respectively on any role. This has been revised in the 5e rules to only apply to natural 20's rolled in combat (turning them in to critical hits), a change I mostly agree with - not everything you might choose to attempt will have at least a 5% chance of success. However, those times when you do roll particularly well (or poorly) still should feel impactful, and so you can expect that there may be some extra effect or bonus on rolling 20's and 1's. Specific examples TBD.

## LuckY Clover

Replaces the [Heroic Inspiration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#HeroicInspiration) rules. These are entirely separate from the Luck Points granted by the [Lucky](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:lucky) feat.

### Acquisition

- If you miss an attack roll you gain 1 Clover.
- If you fail a saving throw you gain 1 Clover.
- The DM can award a Clover for the typical Heroic Inspiration reasons.
- You can never have more than 5 Clover and if you end up going over you immediately roll a d4 and now have that much Clover instead.

### Uses

- After you make a check (but before learning the outcome) you can spend 1 or more  Clover to add +1 to the roll for each Clover spent.
	- This can't create a natural 20 or prevent a natural 1.
- Spend 2 or more Clover to aid an ally you can see on a check. Add +1 for each 2 Clover spent to enhance the roll. 
- After you make ANY roll you can also spend 3 Clover to re-roll all the dice and keep the higher result.
