# Rules Addenda

## Proficiencies
If you would become proficient in a skill or tool and you already had that proficiency, gain a different proficiency of your choice of the same type.

## Luck

Replaces the Heroic Inspiration rules.
- Acquiring 
	- If you miss an attack roll you gain 1 luck.
	- If you fail a saving throw you gain 1 luck.
	- The DM can award a point of luck for the typical Heroic Inspiration reasons.
	- You can never have more than 5 luck and if you end up going over you immediately roll a d4 and now have that much luck instead.
- Uses
	- After you make a check (but before learning the outcome) you can spend 1 luck to add +1 to the roll - up to as much as you have.
		- This doesn't create a natural 20 or prevent a natural 1.
	- Spend 2 or more Hero Points to aid an ally you can see on a check. Add +1 for each 2 Hero points spent to enhance the roll. 
	- After you make ANY roll you can also spend 3 luck to re-roll all the dice and keep the higher result.
