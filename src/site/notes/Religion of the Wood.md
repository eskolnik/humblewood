# RELIGION OF THE WOOD

## The Amaranthine

The Amaranthine are venerated by all races of Humblewood, although birdfolk and humblefolk worship them differently. The five whose origins are described in the “Tales of the Amaranthine” (Altus, Clhuran, Gesme, Reya, and Hanera), are primarily worshiped by birdfolk, and they (along with Ardea and Tyton) form the most common pantheon worshiped across the Wood.

While humblefolk still recognize the birdfolk pantheon, most worship Amaranthine specific to their culture and heritage. Belief in these Amaranthine is not as widespread, but their power is just as real.

The humblefolk Amaranthine are less cohesive, with each having varied tales and origin myths, rather than a single origin story. Many fables are told of the Humblefolk Amaranthine, such as the time Kren tricked Gesme into dropping her flaming staff to flush game out of a bush, or when Henwin sheltered Gaspard from a great monster.

To Humblefolk who live outside of birdfolk perches, Ardea and Tyton are known as Dawnmother and Nightfather. They are depicted in forms that closely resemble the features of the Humblefolk who worship them.
