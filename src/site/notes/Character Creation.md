# Character Creation

We'll be using the 2024 version of the 5e [rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/creating-a-character), which involve a a few changes from the original 2014 rules. In summary:
- **Choose a starting class.**
	- All classes now select their subclass at level 3 (whereas previously this was different for each class). We're starting at level 1, so you don't need to do this now, but you may want to have a subclass in mind as you level up.

> [!humble] 
>  
>   #_humble_callout  |       |
>  | --- | --- |
>  ![strig_icon_sq_100.png](/img/user/assets/strig_icon_sq_100.png) |  If you want to play an Artificer (or any other class that doesn't appear in the 2024 Player's Handbook), or use a subclass from an older book, that's generally going to be fine, just talk with me about it first. Converting older content to work with the new rules is usually fairly straightforward. |

- **Choose a species**
	- Previously, your choice of species had an effect on your ability scores. That's no longer the case - instead, they're based on your Background.
	
> [!humble] 
>  
>   #_humble_callout  |       |
>  | --- | --- |
>  ![strig_icon_sq_100.png](/img/user/assets/strig_icon_sq_100.png) | I'd strongly encourage using the species options from the Humblewood setting (either the original or Beyond the Canopy), but if you want to play something from the core books or elsewhere, talk to me and we'll work out how your character ended up in the Humblewood. |

- **Choose your Background**
	- Each background lists 3 ability scores. You can boost two of those by +2/+1 respectively, or all three by +1. 
	- If you're using an older background that doesn't include a feat, gain an [Origin feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all#Origin).
	- The backgrounds in the Humblewood books have some setting-specific tie-ins, but that doesn't mean that other backgrounds can't be just as deeply integrated into the world.
	- Backgrounds are more like guidelines. Any combination of any of the components (ability scores, origin feat, two skill proficiencies, a tool proficiency, 50GP worth of equipment) is fine with me, so long as you expand on it a bit in your character's story.
- **Choose ability scores**
	- Use the [point buy]([Creating a Character](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/creating-a-character#Step3DetermineAbilityScores)) method, then apply your background's bonuses to them.

## BackStory

Refer to the [[World Atlas\|World Atlas]] to help figure out where your character comes from and/or resides. And while it's by no means required that your character be religious or spiritual, many denizens of the wood tend to be fairly in tune with 

In addition to the backgrounds in the HW books, here are a few ideas based on the standard 5e background if you want some help to get you started on a backstory. 

##### Acolytes, Hermits, and Sages

- Although the Tenders are most well known across the Wood for their involvement in healing and studying the Scorched Grove, their order is actually far more ancient. Wardens of nature, they use their gentle magic to mediate between the people of the Wood and the living forest itself, and to help the forest heal from natural disasters
- Cervan villages are typically led by a community elder who is wise both in politics as well as in the ways of the Amaranthine. Priests provide guidance to the community, and keep stories of a village’s history
- Out of reverence for nature, some gallus dedicate themselves to the study and preservation of the Wood, becoming druidic wardens of the forest, or acting as guides. Gallus who are not content to settle into everyday life in small communities venture out to secluded monasteries and learn the way of the monk.
- Many who apply to study at the Avium are turned away by the prestigious institution. Spurred by their desire for knowledge, rejected candidates sometimes start on a path to become self-taught masters of arcana. Hedges are particularly in tune with the magic of the forest and are often able to learn secrets inaccessible to traditional students.
- Pairing their natural gifts with magical education, powerful luma wizards and radical scholars have been at the forefront of magical innovation for some time in Humblewood.
- You may reside in Alderheart (the capital city), Ashbarrow (which has access to an observatory), the Avium (the magical college), the Scorched Grove (where the Tenders try to learn more about the Calamity), Winnowing Reach (where Slime research is conducted), or a smaller community (for example, an small Cervan village or a Gallus monastery).


##### Folk Heroes, Guild Artisans, and Merchants

- Farming in Humblewood may be done on land or in the branches of perches. Farming in the canopy consists of growing moss gardens, fruit-bearing vines, raising large insects for food, or tending silkworms for clothing.
- The gallus folk value honest work, such as farming and smithing
- Mapach craftspeople who constantly look for ways to improve upon past creations find themselves branded as eccentrics. Their methods are unconventional, but eminently practical.
- Raptors are adept at living off the land. They are skilled hunters, usually leading the harvesting of meat and skins for their perches
- Farming communities include Ashbarrow, Brackenmill, Marshview, and Meadowfen,
- Hubs of merchant activities are found in Alderheart, Brackenmill, and Saltar’s Point.


##### Entertainers and Charlatans
- Recognized for being excellent diplomats, many hedges turn their natural charm towards the talent of entertaining.
- Jerbeens and Vulpins are also known for their charm, which may suit them to a life of either showbiz and/or trickery.
- Most entertainers will be found somewhere in Alderheart, whether that is in the affluent canopy, the trunk, or the root-slums.


##### Criminals and Urchins
- While criminals can often be found picking pockets in large perch cities, only the most successful end up recruited by the Bandit Coalition.
- Small of stature, jerbeens can easily move about unnoticed. This, coupled with their swiftness and natural charm, makes jerbeens perfectly suited for the thieving arts.
- Often judged on sight to be criminals, some mapachs find it hard to integrate into birdfolk society and turn to crime to survive.
- Vulpins, with their natural ambition, cunning, and force of personality, can readily be found climbing to the rank of captain among the bandit forces: leading units on raids and ambushes, and sometimes running the operations of an entire camp.
- Frequently members of criminal organizations, contract killers can be found in the Wood’s largest and most politically complex perches. Corvums, with their natural intelligence and cunning, make the best assassins.
- Criminal activity is rampant in the roots of Alderheart and in the busy hub of Saltar’s Port, but many of the Bandit Coalition can be found on the outskirts of society – for instance, along the Talongrip Coast or in the Crest mountains.
  

##### Knights, Gladiators, and Soldiers

- Aspiring recruits from all over the Wood flock to the Perch Guard headquarters in the capital of Alderheart to join their ranks before returning home to serve. Under the Humblefolk Treaty, members of the Perch Guard are tasked to aid nearby villages on the forest floor whenever necessary. In larger cities, the Perch Guard are also responsible for dealing with inner city issues such as robbery, bar fights, and investigating and arresting criminals.
- In smaller perches, where a guard force may be minimal or nonexistent, town security consists of a locally-organized militia. Anyone can enlist in these groups, provided they are upstanding citizens.
- The Perch Guard produces many skilled soldiers, but only those who possess a great degree of talent are trained to become knights. The knights of Alderheart’s Perch Guard are taught how to protect others by creating opportunities for allies to regroup or retreat as necessary. Strigs, the largest and most powerful of the birdfolk, make up the majority of this upper echelon of the guard.
- Guard members can be found in any large perch or settlement; other, smaller towns may have a local militia instead. Knights reside mostly in Alderheart.
  

##### Sailors and Pirates

- The sea is a way of life for some folk. Jobs in the seafaring industry are as lucrative as they are tough. For the birdfolk that choose to ply their trade on the water, the closed spaces of forest life become stifling compared to the wide-open expanse of the sea.
- Saltar’s port is a busy city with a vibrant sea trade.
- The talongrip coast is home to fisher-folk, mostly sea raptors, mapachs, and jerbeens.


##### Outlanders

- The ranger is an iconic figure in raptor stories and myths, and has inspired many to follow in their legendary footsteps. Outfitted for rough living in the wilds, these rangers are consummate archers and exceptional hunters. Those who have made a life out of exploring often find their service as guides in high demand.
- For Strigs, known for being at ease even in the harshest environments, becoming a tracker can prove a satisfying challenge. Some use their skills to double as bounty hunters, which can provide for an even more thrilling chase.
- Outlanders may squat in the ruins along the Crest Mountains, or in homes along the Talongrip Coast.


##### Nobles

- Although founded by birdfolk, Alderheart is home to several noble families of influential humblefolk. Among them are vulpins who find both their charms and wiles perfectly suited to the political intrigue of Alderheart’s high society. Some vulpin nobles can trace their lineage back to ancient royalty.
- Corvums have undeniable skill in matters of logistics and planning, making them valuable to councils and powerful individuals alike. Corvums are typically found in positions with a modicum of power, such as advisors or minor officials. The stigma they face usually prevents them from attaining too prominent a position in birdfolk society, but corvums are adept at working behind the scenes.


In addition, consider how your race (birdfolk or humblefolk, as well as your specific racial traits) let you fit in or cast you as an outsider. How do you see the other races of the Wood?
