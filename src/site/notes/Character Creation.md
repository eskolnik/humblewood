# Character Creation
We'll be using the 5e 2024 [rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/creating-a-character), which involve a number of changes from the original 2014 rules. In summary:
- Choose a starting class. All classes now select their subclass at level 3 (whereas previously this was different for each class). We're starting at level 1, so you don't need to do this now, but you may want to have a subclass in mind as you level up.
	- If you want to play an Artificer (or any other class that doesn't appear in the 2024 Player's Handbook), or use a subclass from an older book, that's generally going to be fine, converting older content to work with the new rules is usually fairly straightforward.
- Choose a species
	- Previously, your choice of species had an effect on your ability scores. That's no longer the case - instead, it's based on your Background.
	- I'd encourage using the species options from the Humblewood setting, but if you want to play something from the core books (or elsewhere), talk to me and we'll work out how your character ended up in the Humblewood.
- Choose your Background
	- Each background lists 3 ability scores. You can boost two of those by +2/+1 respectively, or all three by +1. 
	- If you're using an older background that doesn't include a feat, gain an [Origin feat](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/feat:all#Origin).
	- Backgrounds are more like guidelines. Any combination of any of the components (ability scores, origin feat, two skill proficiencies, a tool proficiency, 50GP worth of equipment) is fine with me, so long as you expand on it a bit in your character's story.
- Choose ability scores, using the point buy method.
