# The World of Humblewood
![humblewood_map.jpg](/img/user/assets/humblewood_map.jpg)

## Alderheart

Alderheart is home to every race of birdfolk and humblefolk. The thriving community attracts people from faraway lands, like traveling merchants, explorers, and foreign dignitaries. The Great Tree City is divided into three main levels where people live, work, and go about their lives: the canopy, the trunk, and the roots.

The **canopy** contains Alderheart’s most iconic structures, including the chambers of the Birdfolk Council, the headquarters of the Perch Guard, and the largest market in the Wood. Additionally, the canopy holds neighborhoods such as the Boughs (with affluent, high-class homes) and the Branches (modest homes for birdfolk). Vast infrastructures for transportation are common in the canopy, including “Branchroads”, rope bridges, and pulleys connected to platforms on the forest floor. City gates, located at strategic points around the canopy, are the only sanctioned ways to enter the city, and are monitored by Perch Guard watchposts. These gates are connected to lower levels of the tree and the forest floor by large winding stairways that allow travel by foot.

The largest section of the metropolis, the **trunk**, acts as an intermediary zone between the prosperous canopy and the less affluent roots. Many humblefolk make their homes here, where there is a stable floor beneath them. The trunk market is home to humblefolk foods and cultural goods, curiosity shops and sellers of regional wares, as well as inns, taverns, and public houses. The Bright Hollows neighborhood is home to many common homes, mostly for humblefolk. Nicer homes are found on the outside, where natural light can be let in, while simplest homes are found toward the center. The farther down the trunk one travels, the shabbier and more ill-kept the residences and infrastructure become. There are no officially authorized ways to leave or enter the tree by way of lower parts of the trunk.

Beneath the lowest parts of the trunk, a series of tunnels have been carved into the **roots** of Alderheart. At first, the roots were not considered to be official parts of the city, and their development was largely overlooked by city officials in the canopy. Here, the air is always dank and humid, and wild fungi grow rampant. The buildings are mostly cobbled together from scavenged materials, and some have been converted into community gathering places. There are few shops here, and they typically traffic in smuggled and stolen goods. Crime is ever-present.

## Ashbarrow

This small town exists on the fringes of the Scorched Grove, where ash causes the soil to be fertile. The town is inhabited by a mix of birdfolk and humblefolk who shelter within its low stone walls. A large watchtower near the town’s center serves as an observatory for seers who watch the stars for signs and portents.

## The Avium

The Avium is a college of magical arts with a wide range of subjects available for study. It was created from the petrified wood of a dead tree. Controlled by magical fields, the college’s many structures float in a circuit with one another. All hover around the huge central building, equipped with bridges that line up with the main building at regular intervals. Those not gifted with the Glide ability must harness their magic for transportation, or wait until the archways align to allow for foot traffic.

Within the Avium’s classrooms, you will find future Tenders, council members, and protectors of the Wood. All races are welcome within the Avium’s halls, although admittance is granted only by the will of the headmaster and a council of senior staff. The application process is demanding, and the curriculum rigorous. While the classes are diverse, the college does impose certain limitations, most notably regarding necromancy, which is taught mainly in a theoretical sense.

## Brackenmill

Considered a lesser perch due to its proximity to the ground, Brackenmill nevertheless consists of many proximate tree-farms that, after years of growth, melded into one another. It includes a central hub of shops, trade halls, and shipping platforms, all under the watchful eye of the local Perch Guard. Practically every store, tavern, and supplier in Alderheart gets their goods from Brackenmill.

## The Crest

The Crest is the name given to the mountain range to the northeast of Humblewood. Its severe environment supports a variety of goats and small mammals that feast on hearty shrubbery growing between the crags. There are also several unique creatures native to the Crest, including griffons, basilisks, mountain lions, and giant eagles. The Crest is dotted with structures built during different points in history. In addition to garnering interest from archeological teams, some of these mysterious ruins have become home to squatters.

## Marshview

Marshview is extremely disconnected from the goings-on of the Wood. The location has basic amenities, like shops and an inn, but it is not a prime destination for travelers. A balanced mix of birdfolk and humblefolk inhabitants results in architecture unique to Marshview. Several buildings are on the ground, and traditional farming takes advantage of the limited dry ground between the forest and the nearby swamp.

## Meadowfen

Meadowfen is a peaceful village located between the Mokk Fields to the south and a glade of spruce copses to the north. It is a humble village, with a small number of residents. Most are farmers who work either the ash-enriched pastures to the north, or the marshlands to the south, which are ripe with sour berries and waterborne plants.

## Mokk Fields

The confluence of dozens of streams and runoff flows have pooled within the southwestern lowlands of Humblewood, creating a vast wetland. The water here gradually filters out to the Talongrip Coast and into the sea. The fringes of the Mokk Fields are wreathed with reeds, water lilies, and pleasant greenery. Farther into the heart of the swamp, travelers find themselves inundated by stagnant, foul-smelling waters and muddy. The slimy, gnarled trees that grow here are rarely suitable to support a perch.

Plants and creatures found only in the swamp are useful for potion brewing or magical reagents, and there is good coin to be made for people willing to brave the area’s many dangers. Additionally, the Mokk Fields are home to an intricate, vast cavern system that runs beneath the swamps. Scouts who have managed to return reported a significant number of slimes. These are dangerous ooze creatures exclusive to this environment, whose residue has become a sought-after commodity for those with the skill to harvest it.

## Saltar’s Port

For many birdfolk, the idea of building a city on the ground is laughable in itself, but to build on the rocky coastline with the express intent of sailing ships was considered a gross misuse of resources. After heated debates, a group of birdfolk broke off and founded the port city on their own. Saltar’s Port serves as the only access for ships coming to or leaving from Humblewood. It has sparked a vibrant trade business, offering the riches of the Wood to far-off cities and kingdoms.

## Scorched Grove

Centuries ago, the area known as the Scorched Grove was once a lush forest of calm meadows and peaceful glades. Then, the Great Calamity came. The Grove refused to heal. Stranger still, the soil beneath the ashen steppes still smolders with embers. The air here carries a supernatural heat that can exhaust travelers or even cause burns depending on its fierceness. This hostile landscape is home to a variety of curious fire-aspected creatures with extra-planar origins. Each year, the Grove pushes on the boundary of the forest, growing slightly as its edges are set ablaze by windblown embers or fire-infused creatures.

## Talongrip Coast

These small settlements are sparsely decorated, focusing on stability and protection from the salty winds of the ocean. Homes are chiseled out of the rock faces, with wooden platforms serving as walkways between them. On more vertical slopes, buildings are connected by a veritable forest of ropes and cables used to get from place to place. Citizens of coastal perches and villages are primarily folk who wish to remain close to the water. Sea raptors, mapachs, and jerbeens have carved out space for themselves along the coast, sometimes literally. These seaside settlements focus on fishing and salt drying, exporting their cured fish to the rest of the Wood. The coast is susceptible to danger from weather and predatory creatures such as lizards, giant crabs, and wakewyrms.

## Winnowing Reach

Winnowing Reach is a relatively new development in the Wood. It started as a modest outpost, a last stop for researchers and slime-wranglers bound for the Mokk Fields. When folk began disappearing in the swamp, it was decreed that a more permanent settlement be constructed to hold a small contingent of Perch Guard. To this end, the perch was hastily constructed within a small stand of willow trees. Thanks to the profits from slime-wrangling, Winnowing Reach has grown to include businesses specializing in harvesting and shipping slime residue. The trade is mainly with the Avium for educational, research, and experimental purposes, but other buyers are appearing at a steady pace.
