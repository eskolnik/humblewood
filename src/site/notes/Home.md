# Welcome to The Humblewood

In the faraway world of Everden, on the eastern coast of a great continent, lies a vast forest nestled between the mountains and the sea. This is the Humblewood, an ancient and magical place that hums an endless song, sung to the Great Rhythm of life and death.

In the early years, birdfolk and humblefolk lived close to each other in small villages around the forest.

These isolated communities were vulnerable to an organization of brigands and marauders who called themselves the “Bandit Coalition.” To protect themselves from the Coalition, the birdfolk built fortified cities in the forest’s canopy. They shaped their mighty capital from the great tree Alderheart. The birdfolk army, known as the “Perch Guard”, drove back the bandits, bringing peace and security to the region. The birdfolk also offered the humblefolk safety within their great city, and many accepted.

The humblefolk represent a disparate group of peoples, cultures, and ways of seeing the world, many of whom haven’t always seen eye to eye. As the city of Alderheart was being formed, an accord was struck between the people of the forest floor to quell the in-fighting that was wreaking havoc among them. This accord was known as the “Humblefolk Treaty” and was witnessed by the birdfolk. Humblefolk began to live once again in small woodland villages beneath the trees, in more diverse communities alongside some ground-dwelling birdfolk. However, birdfolk who choose to live on the forest floor find themselves stigmatized, as a life in the canopy is considered proper in birdfolk society.

In contrast to the humblefolk, the birdfolk races share much of their culture, language, history, and origin myths. Over time, birdfolk culture spread, and the capital city of Alderheart became the most politically influential place in the Wood. This solidarity has allowed the birdfolk to work together and prosper, creating a harmony in the Wood which has lasted for an age. The birdfolk have established themselves as a political force to be reckoned with in Humblewood. The Birdfolk Council, makes decisions that impact all of Humblewood, and they are well-defended from outside threats thanks to the Perch Guard.

But the Wood has also known sorrow. Not long after the founding of Alderheart, a massive forest fire known as “The Great Calamity” burned a portion of the Wood. The origins of the fire are unknown, but it left the area permanently damaged. To this day, it is called the “Scorched Grove,” an arid field of ash that has since become home to many strange flame-infused creatures.

Recently, fires have begun to rage through the Wood with a strength and fury not seen since ages past. Forest-dwellers are again being displaced from their homes, seeking refuge in Alderheart, and perch-dwellers are doing what they can to keep themselves safe up in their canopy sanctuaries. Relations between the humblefolk and birdfolk are tense. Moreover, a newly invigorated Bandit Coalition swells in numbers. Its sights are set upon Alderheart, where those displaced by the flames seek a means of survival.

With the spreading flames, humblefolk villagers petitioned the overextended Perch Guard for aid, only to see help arrive too late, if at all. To make matters worse, after many years the divisions between the humblefolk communities have intensified. Some humblefolk have even left to join the newly reformed Bandit Coalition, seeing not only a path for survival, but a chance to get even with the perch-dwelling birdfolk for broken oaths and unequal treatment.

## Our story begins in Meadowfen

Meadowfen is a peaceful village located between the Mokk Fields to the south and a glade of spruce copses to the north. It is a humble village, with a small number of residents. Most are farmers. Meadowfen has been quiet for as long as anyone can remember, and life here goes by slowly. Its closeness to the marsh keeps it safe from attacks from fire-based creatures from the Scorched Grove. Its distance from the Mokk Fields ensures deadly slimes don’t stray into the village.

Recently, it has fallen on hard times. Seasonal rainfalls haven’t arrived, leaving the fields barren. To make matters worse, trade wagons sent to provide relief have gone missing, fueling rumors of bandits prowling the roadways. Fire-based creatures are venturing closer to the village than ever before. A week ago, an ominous plume of black smoke to the north blocked the sun. A few brave villagers ventured out to investigate, but they haven’t returned. The source of the smoke remains unknown.

For whatever reason, you find yourself in Meadowfen. You may be a local of Meadowfen, or an adventurer from elsewhere in Humblewood, or even from outside the region. Maybe you are on your way to see the magnificent city of Alderheart – a tourist unwittingly caught up in the trouble, or a concerned citizen seeking an audience with the Birdfolk Council. Maybe you are a refugee from a surrounding area - perhaps Ashbarrow, besieged by bandits - or perhaps you yourself had been involved with them.
