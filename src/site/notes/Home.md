# Welcome to The Humblewood

In the faraway world of Everden, on the eastern coast of a great continent, lies a vast forest nestled between the mountains and the sea. This is the Humblewood, an ancient and magical place that hums an endless song, sung to the Great Rhythm of life and death. The Wood, as it is known to its inhabitants, is not like any other forest. The trees are old and powerful, with rare specimens that reach as tall as small mountains. Here, familiar beats grow to unusual sizes, bearing markings and patterns unique to the Wood. This region is also home to two groups of animal-like humanoid races, the birdfolk and the humblefolk. Together, they share the Wood and its bountiful resouces.

## Our story begins in Meadowfen

Meadowfen is a peaceful village located between the Mokk Fields to the south and a glade of spruce copses to the north. It is a humble village, with a small number of residents. Most are farmers. Meadowfen has been quiet for as long as anyone can remember, and life here goes by slowly. Its closeness to the marsh keeps it safe from attacks from fire-based creatures from the Scorched Grove. Its distance from the Mokk Fields ensures deadly slimes don’t stray into the village.

Recently, it has fallen on hard times. Seasonal rainfalls haven’t arrived, leaving the fields barren. To make matters worse, trade wagons sent to provide relief have gone missing, fueling rumors of bandits prowling the roadways. Fire-based creatures are venturing closer to the village than ever before. A week ago, an ominous plume of black smoke to the north blocked the sun. A few brave villagers ventured out to investigate, but they haven’t returned. The source of the smoke remains unknown.

At the start of our story, you will find yourself in Meadowfen. You may be a local of Meadowfen, having lived there all your life or just returning to visit. You might be an adventurer from elsewhere in Humblewood, or even from outside the region. Maybe you are on your way to see the magnificent city of Alderheart – a tourist unwittingly caught up in the trouble, or a concerned citizen seeking an audience with the Birdfolk Council. Maybe you are a refugee from a surrounding area - perhaps Ashbarrow, besieged by bandits - or perhaps you yourself had been involved with them.
