## Character Creation
We'll be using the 5e 2024 [rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/creating-a-character), which involve a number of changes from the original 2014 rules. In summary:
- Choose a starting class. All classes now select their subclass at level 3 (whereas previously this was different for each class). We're starting at level 1, so you don't need to do this now, but you may want to have a subclass in mind as you level up.
	- If you want to play an Artificer (or any other class that doesn't appear in the 2024 Player's Handbook), or use a subclass from an older book, that's generally going to be fine, converting older content to work in the new rules is usually fairly straightforward.
- Choose a species
	- Previously, your choice of species had an effect on your ability scores. That's no longer the case - instead, it's based on your Background.
	- I'd encourage using the species options from the Humblewood setting, but if you want to play something from the core books (or elsewhere), talk to me and we'll work out how your character ended up in the Humblewood.
- Choose a Background
	- Each background lists 3 ability scores. You're meant to boost two of those three by +2/+1 respectively, or all three by +1.
	- If you're using an older background that doesn't include a feat, gain an Origin feat.
	- Backgrounds are more like guidelines. Any combination of any of the components (ability scores, origin feat, two skill proficiencies, a tool proficiency, 50GP worth of equipment) is fine with me, so long as you expand on it a bit in your character's story.
	- 
- Choose ability scores, using the point buy method.

## Rules Addenda
### Luck / Acorns / Clover
Replaces the Heroic Inspiration rules
- Acquisition
	- Everyone starts with 0 luck (per session? Or carryover)
	- If you miss an attack roll you gain 1 luck
	- If you fail a saving throw you gain 1 luck
	- The DM can award a point of luck for the typical Heroic Inspiration reasons
	- You can never have more than 5 luck and if you end up going over you immediately roll a d4 and now have that much luck instead
- Uses
	- After you make a check (but before learning the outcome) you can spend 1 luck to add +1 to the roll - up to as much as you have.
		- This doesn't create a natural 20 or prevent a natural 1.
	- Spend 2 or more Hero Points to aid an ally you can see. Add +1 for each 2 Hero points spent to enhance the roll. 
	- After you make ANY roll you can also spend 3 luck to re-roll all the dice and keep the higher result.
